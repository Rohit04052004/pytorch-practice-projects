# PyTorch Projects – From Basics to BERT 🔥🧠

This repository contains my **code and notes** from the [PyTorch Hands-On Course by Omar M. Atef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aD2xsvP7Cc), hosted on **freeCodeCamp.org**. The course walks through **five real-world projects** and helped me understand PyTorch's syntax, core components, and how to apply them to various machine learning domains.
